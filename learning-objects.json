The basic premise of the module is that human adversaries are what differentiates cybersecurity from other technical disciplines such as computer science, and, therefore, the concept of adversarial thinking is central to cybersecurity. The goal of the module is to produce enduring strategic-mindedness in students who may otherwise tend to equate cybersecurity with technology-based best practices. This is a stand-alone, self-contained module, with no knowledge prerequisites. It contains three lessons of approximately one hour each. &nbsp;The module can be incorporated into virtually any university-level course. This module has been experimentally validated and is the subject of two peer-reviewed journal articles (cited in the syllabus).</p>\n",

The RSA algorithm is built upon number theories, and it can be quite easily implemented with the support of libraries. The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain hands-on experiences on the RSA algorithm. From lectures, students should have learned the theoretic part of the RSA algorithm, so they know mathematically how to generate public/private keys and how to perform encryption/decryption and signature generation/verification. This lab enhances student’s understanding of RSA by requiring them to go through every essential step of the RSA algorithm on actual numbers, so they can apply the theories learned from the class.

One method is to match TCP Send and Echo packets by examining the sequence and acknowledgement number of the packets.&nbsp; Due to the complexity of computer network traffic, this approach is only applicable to local area network which has no crossover packets.

The 1st lesson teaches ethical paradigms for reasoning about right and wrong so that ethical hackers can proceed with moral clarity when confronted with ethical grey areas. The 2nd&nbsp;lesson covers the U.S.&nbsp;Constitution so that ethical hackers can understand and respect the rights of all citizens impacted by their activities. The 3rd lesson addresses federal and international statutes so that ethical hackers can abide by all necessary legal boundaries and authorities.&nbsp;It contains 3 lessons of approximately 1&nbsp;hour each and a short introductory lesson so that it can&nbsp;be taught in a typical 3-semester hour week. This module was specifically designed to address the Legal and Ethics Knowledge Unit from the Academic Content criterion of the NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations program.</p>",

There will be programming exercises for students to implement two-party computation (e.g., <em>max</em>(x,y)) and three-party rock-paper-scissors game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lab Description: </strong>This module consists of two lab exercises and a bonus exercise. This helps in getting the grip on the solidity language used to write smart contracts which can be deployed on the blockchain. This lab concentrates on using the Remix IDE which is available to write, test, compile and deploy the smart contract, without need to set up any blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Recent studies have shown that most attackers use repeated attack pattern behaviors in executing their attacks. By carrying out attacks in phases, attackers can methodically complete their attack mission without being detected by defenders. Knowledge of these attack tactics and techniques can help defenders emulate known attack strategies and evaluate their defense strength and weakness in identifying and stopping these attacks. These phases include reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, command and control, execution and maintenance. The early phase of the attack lifecycle consists of the reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, and exploitation, while the late phase consists of command and control, execution, and maintenance.</p>\n",

With an increase in targeted attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), enterprise system defenders require a comprehensive framework that allows them to detect these attacks. MITRE has developed a framework which includes a database of different kill-chains, tactics, techniques, and procedures that attackers employ to perform these attacks. By collecting data from different endpoints in an enterprise which include network and system call level traces, enterprise defenders can detect and mitigate APT attacks. By leveraging the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, we build a system that uses the collected data to classify attack traces to tactics used by an attacker. A typical attack trace consists of various tactical actions as attackers leverage multiple tactics to achieve their goal. To detect these tactics, we formulate the problem as a multi-label classification problem.</p>\n",

When dealing with virtual networks, we usually need virtual switches for creating complex network topology. Virtual switching solutions such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) has gained a lot of attentions recently for its strength in managing large and ever-changing network infrastructures. But before SDN came into existence, Linux bridge was already a popular virtual switching tool, and it still is nowadays. A bridge, just like a physical switch, is a device to unite network segments transparently by forwarding the network traffic from the network devices connected to it. In this lab, we will first go through some Linux networking concepts and tools which can later help us understand the way Linux bridge works. Then, we will look into Linux bridge from both application and implementation perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For lab solutions, please contact Dr. Mengjun Xie&nbsp;&nbsp;(mengjun-xie@utc.edu).</p>",

Following is the list of modules included in this Unit,</p>\n\n<p>1. The basics of complex numbers.</p>\n\n<p>2. Properties of complex numbers.</p>\n\n<p>3. Complex numbers on a plane.</p>\n\n<p>4. Complex vector spaces.</p>\n\n<p>5. Complex vector spaces: linear combination, independence, basis and dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>6. Properties and operations on vectors and matrices in complex vector spaces.</p>\n\n<p>7. Advanced concepts in complex vector spaces.</p>\n\n<p>8. Overview of tensor analysis.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Students will learn when and how to report cybercrimes committed against them or people they know. At a broader level, students will discuss the possible types of cybercrime and profiles of cybercriminals. From an organizational perspective, barriers to responding, such as attribution and jurisdictional issues, are covered. Students will explore ways of preventing and deterring cybercrime from a law enforcement and policy perspective.

The tasks&nbsp;are divided into three lab modules. The first module&nbsp;focuses on certificate issuance and revocation;&nbsp;the second module focuses on the chain of trust; and the third module simulates a scenario of man-in-the-middle attack against&nbsp;this infrastructure. Since there are quite a few overlaps between these modules, follow the order would help you go through them.</p>\n\n<p>Environment</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.geni.net/\">GENI</a> is a cloud-based networking experimentation testbed. For each lab module, you have to create a separate slice in GENI, and reserve resources as described in lab manuals. After the resources are available, connect to those VMs through ssh and do the correspondent tasks. If you have difficulty setting up the environment, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIExperimenter/Tutorials\">beginner's guide</a>&nbsp;for how to use GENI.</p>",

Generally, they fall into two categories, one is the permission ( private ) blockchain, and the other is the public blockchains. The permission blockchains only allow authorized people to join, while public blockchains allow anyone to be its member. This is the most prevailing way that people classify blockchains.</p>\n\n<p>However, some people are not satisfied with this categorization. They argued about the legitimacy of blockchain being permissioned. In a private blockchain, the trust is no more decentralized and transparent, and it is hard to find any difference between permission blockchains and decentralized database. As a result, they don't even view private blockchains as real blockchains.</p>\n\n<p>In this lab, you will try to build a certificate management application using smart contract in Hyperledger Fabric in a private blockchain. You will first build the environment, run their sample code, Fabcar, then finally rewrite/replace some of the code in it.&nbsp;</p>",
